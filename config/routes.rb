  # This line mounts Forem's routes at /forums by default.
  # This means, any requests to the /forums URL of your application will go to Forem::ForumsController#index.
  # If you would like to change where this extension is mounted, simply change the :at option to something different.
  #
  # We ask that you don't use the :as option here, as Forem relies on it being the default of "forem"

	# The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
	# See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes".

	# Example of regular route:
	#   get 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'

	# Example of named route that can be invoked with purchase_url(id: product.id)
	#   get 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', as: :purchase

	# Example resource route with options:
	#   resources :products do
	#     member do
	#       get 'short'
	#       post 'toggle'
	#     end
	#
	#     collection do
	#       get 'sold'
	#     end
	#   end

	# Example resource route with sub-resources:
	#   resources :products do
	#     resources :comments, :sales
	#     resource :seller
	#   end

	# Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
	#   resources :products do
	#     resources :comments
	#     resources :sales do
	#       get 'recent', on: :collection
	#     end
	#   end

	# Example resource route with concerns:
	#   concern :toggleable do
	#     post 'toggle'
	#   end
	#   resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
	#   resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable

	# Example resource route within a namespace:
	#   namespace :admin do
	#     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
	#     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
	#     resources :products
	#   end
